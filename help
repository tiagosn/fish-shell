	   FISH - Fast and Intelligent SHell!!!

Introduction
============

This is Fish Shell, version 0.1. This simple shell is a example  
of implementation of the POSIX shell spec,but also with interactive 
command line editing, job control on architectures that support it, 
csh-like features such as history substitution and brace expansion, 
and a slew of other features. There is also a large Unix-style man 
page.The man page is the definitive description of the shell's 
features. 

See the file POSIX for a discussion of how the Fish defaults differ
from the POSIX spec and a description of the Fish `posix mode'.

Fish is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU] General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
version 3 of the License (or any later version).  For more information,
see the file COPYING. 

To compile Fish, type `make', then `./fish' to execute the shell.  
Fish auto-configures the build process, so no further intervention 
should be necessary.  Fish builds with `gcc' by default if it is 
available.

Reporting Bugs
==============

Bug reports for fish should be sent to darlanpj@gmail.com, 
                                       amaral.felipeaugusto@gmail.com or 
                                       tigosn92@gmail.com
with the following information:

	* the version number and release status of Fish (e.g., 0.05a-release)
	* the machine and OS that it is running on (you may run
	  `fishversion -l' from the fish build directory for this information)
	* a list of the compilation flags or the contents of `config.h', if
	  appropriate
	* a description of the bug
	* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
	* a fix for the bug if you have one!


While the Fish maintainers do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
like this shell to be the best that we can make it.

Enjoy!
